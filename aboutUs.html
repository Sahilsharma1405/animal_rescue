        <p class="about_p">
            At PurrFect , we are dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating animals in need and finding them loving, forever homes. Our goal is to provide every pet with a second chance at life, fostering compassion, education, and a community that values adoption over buying. Together, we can make a difference, one rescue at a time.

        <h2 class="about_head">Story behind Organisation</h2>
        <p class="about_p">
            What started as a small group of passionate animal lovers has grown into a rescue that has transformed countless lives. PurrFect was founded by Sahil Sharma in 2019, with a simple yet powerful mission: to give abandoned and neglected animals a second chance at life. <br>
            From humble beginnings, we've rescued and rehomed hundreds of pets, offering them a safe place to heal and a    bright future with loving families. Each rescue is more than just a pet—it's a story of hope, compassion, and the belief that every animal deserves a happy ending. <br>
            We continue to grow, one rescue at a time, and we're grateful for the support of our community in helping us    create lasting change for animals in need.

                    Luna was found hiding in a small, abandoned shed, hungry and frightened. She had been living on her own for weeks, struggling to survive on scraps, her fur matted, and her eyes filled with fear. It was clear she needed help, but trust didn't come easily to her. <br>
                    When our rescue team arrived, Luna was cautious, but we knew she deserved a chance at a better life. Gently, we coaxed her into our arms and brought her to safety. After a trip to the vet and some time in a loving foster home, Luna began to blossom. Slowly but surely, she started to trust again. Her once sad eyes began to sparkle, and her playful personality started to shine through. <br>
                    It wasn't long before Luna found her forever home, where she is now pampered and loved by a family who adores her. Her journey from fear to freedom is a testament to the power of rescue and the endless possibilities for cats in need.

                    Max was just another stray on the streets, abandoned and alone, with no hope of a better life. He wandered the alleys, searching for food, and trusting no one. He had been through a lot — malnourished, scared, and injured — but the world had turned its back on him. <br>
                    That's when Animal Aid stepped in. Our team found Max huddled in a corner, trembling and in pain. It was clear he needed help, and we were determined to give him the second chance he so desperately deserved. <br>
                    After months of care, medical attention, and love, Max began to heal. His fur grew back, his wounds closed, and, most importantly, his heart started to trust again. Max was no longer just a scared dog; he was a survivor, full of hope and love.

                    Eventually, Max found his forever home with a family that adores him. He's now living the life he always deserved — full of belly rubs, playtime, and unconditional love. <br>
                    Max's story is just one of many, and it's because of people like you — who believe in the power of rescue — that we can continue to make these life-changing transformations.
